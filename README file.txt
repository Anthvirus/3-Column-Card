## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt more about media queries, styling elements and components, padding and margins. I also built my first responsive project without using any CSS framework.


### Continued development

I will focus more on everything in general, apying special attention to grids and flexboxes, margins and paddings, setting measurements on elements.
